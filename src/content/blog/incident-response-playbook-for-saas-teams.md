An incident response playbook is the fastest way to improve SaaS reliability because it reduces confusion when seconds matter. Teams with a clear process recover faster and communicate better.

## Decide roles before the incident

Assign an incident lead, a communications owner, and a technical lead. Keep the roles stable so everyone knows who is driving decisions.

:::warning Avoid silent incidents

If customers notice the issue before you publish an update, trust drops immediately. Write the first update early, even if details are limited.

:::

## Define severity and escalation

If everything is “urgent,” nothing is. Define severity levels that map to action. For example, a partial outage with a workaround is a different workflow than a full outage that prevents login.

Make escalation explicit: who is paged, when leadership is notified, and when you involve vendors. This is especially important for incidents that affect authentication, billing, or data export.

## Use a consistent update format

```json tab="Status update"
{
  "status": "investigating",
  "impact": "some users cannot log in",
  "nextUpdateInMinutes": 30
}
```

```json tab="Resolution update"
{
  "status": "resolved",
  "rootCause": "misconfigured auth cache",
  "prevention": "added config validation and alerts"
}
```

## Communicate like a product team

Good incident updates are short and repeatable. They answer three questions:

1. What is impacted and who is impacted.
2. What you are doing right now.
3. When the next update will happen.

Avoid long technical threads in customer-facing updates. Save deep root cause detail for the postmortem, and keep the live updates focused on impact and progress.

<Details title="A good first message">

State what is impacted, what you are doing, and when you will update next. Do not speculate. If there is a workaround, share it clearly.

</Details>

## Close the loop with a postmortem

After the incident, write a short postmortem that includes timeline, root cause, and prevention actions. Keep it factual. The goal is to reduce recurrence and improve detection, not to assign blame.

If you have recurring performance issues, document the mitigations in your documentation so support and success can reference the same guidance.

## Practice the playbook

A playbook that lives only in a document will fail under pressure. Run a short drill once a quarter: simulate an auth outage, practice the first update, and verify that on-call can escalate properly.

The goal is not to be perfect. The goal is to reduce surprise. After a drill, update the checklist and remove steps that are unclear or slow.

## Track follow-up actions to completion

Most incidents feel “done” when the service is back, but reliability improves when follow-up actions actually ship. Treat prevention work like product work: assign owners, set deadlines, and review progress in a regular cadence.

If you have recurring issues, add a simple trend review. Look for patterns in the last few incidents and decide what system improvements will reduce the whole class of failures, not just the last one.

## Conclusion

A playbook turns chaos into routine. If you do not have a public place to post updates, start with a simple page and make it easy to find from your contact page.
