Feature flags help SaaS teams ship faster, but unmanaged flags quietly become technical debt. A small set of rules keeps delivery speed high without losing control.

## Use flags for specific reasons

Flags are best for gradual rollouts, experiments, and risk isolation. Avoid using them as long-term configuration for everything. If a flag will live forever, it should become a real setting.

:::tip Set an expiration date

Every flag should have a removal date and an owner. If you cannot name both, do not add the flag.

:::

## Treat flags like a lifecycle

A healthy flag has a beginning, a middle, and an end. The beginning is rollout and safety. The middle is measurement and iteration. The end is deletion.

If you skip the end, your codebase accumulates branches that nobody understands. The result is slower development and riskier releases over time.

## Roll out safely and observe impact

A rollout plan should include a kill switch and a way to measure impact. Without measurement, flags turn into “hope-driven deployment.” Track one or two metrics per rollout, such as activation rate, error rate, or support tickets.

When something goes wrong, your first goal is to stop the bleeding. A kill switch is valuable only if it is fast and well understood. Practice using it during normal hours, not for the first time at 2 a.m.

## Centralize flags and make ownership visible

Chaos usually starts when flags are scattered across multiple systems and nobody knows who owns them. Keep a single registry that shows the flag name, purpose, owner, and planned removal date. If you use multiple environments, include the rollout state in each environment so teams do not debug the wrong configuration.

Also limit who can create new flags. It is easier to keep flags healthy when creation is intentional, reviewed, and tied to a rollout plan.

```typescript
type Flag = {
  key: string;
  owner: string;
  expiresAt: string;
  description: string;
};

const flags: Flag[] = [
  {
    key: 'new-onboarding-flow',
    owner: 'growth',
    expiresAt: '2025-07-01',
    description: 'Gradual rollout of the new onboarding milestone view',
  },
];
```

## Make cleanup part of shipping

Add a short “flag removal” task to your release checklist and track it like any other deliverable. Keep the rules in your documentation so new engineers do not invent their own patterns.

<Details title="A simple naming convention">

Use names that describe the user-facing outcome, not the internal implementation. Include the owner team in documentation, and keep a short note about what “on” means for customers.

</Details>

## Remove flags aggressively

Once a rollout is complete, the flag should disappear. Delete the conditional branches, remove config, and simplify tests. This is where teams usually stop because there is no immediate payoff, but it is the difference between a codebase that gets faster and a codebase that gets slower.

If a flag needs to become a permanent option, convert it into a real setting with a clear owner. Permanent flags are hidden configuration and they create confusing behavior over time.

## Conclusion

Feature flags are a tool, not a strategy. Use them to reduce risk, then delete them when the rollout is complete.
